# Stray Cat Craft
Inspired by the game Stray, this datapack lets you play Minecraft as a stray Jellie cat. 

To get the full effect, go into f5 3rd-person mode.

_Note_: cats are notoriously difficult to control, and this stray cat is no different.

Very nice map to play on: https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/apocalypse-city-build-by-the-artful-community/
